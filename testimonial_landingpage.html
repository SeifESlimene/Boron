                  “So far we have Facilities and Security using this system. 
                  There is nothing I do not use in HappyFox and
                  our team likes the app, the reports, the smart rules, and the tags. We enter 
                  tickets and complete them
                  daily and HappyFox has improved our average number of tickets completed per month. My customers (Health
                  Center Staff) have all responded very positively to the change; they love that they can see all the
                  ticketsfor their site and comment on whether they’re still needed.”

				implemented the solution for email tracking but are now leveraging it to track incoming invoices as
				well. If a business is facing similar problems to ours in terms of tracking incoming emails or a high
				number of incoming emails from the same customers or suppliers, in my opinion HappyFox really is the
				best solution to resolve this. With HappyFox, you really are able to track everything that is coming in,
				and analyze the data in real-time.”
